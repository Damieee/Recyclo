# RECYCLO RESTful API

## Introduction:

This is a `RESTful API` that allows a mobile application to interact with a database of registered users, GPS data, recycle bin locations, and reward cards. It is built using Flask, a Python web framework that allows developers to create web applications and APIs quickly and easily.
